### Task Details

#### Part 1: Fetch Current Weather Data for Multiple Cities
1. **Endpoint**:  
   Use the **Current Weather Data** API:  
   ```
   https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
   ```

2. **Parameters**:  
   Pass the following query parameters:
   - `q` (City name): Add at least 3 cities (e.g., London, Paris, New York).
   - `appid` (Your API key)
   - `units` (Optional: Set to `metric` for temperatures in Celsius)

   **Example URL for London**:  
   ```
   https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric
   ```

3. **Save Results**:
   - Save the JSON response for each city into a separate file named `cityname_weather.json`.
     - Example: `london_weather.json`, `paris_weather.json`, `newyork_weather.json`.

#### Part 2: Fetch 5-Day/3-Hour Weather Forecast for a Specific City
1. **Endpoint**:  
   Use the **5-Day/3-Hour Forecast** API:  
   ```
   https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast
   ```

2. **Parameters**:  
   Pass the following query parameters:
   - `q` (City name): Choose one city of your choice.
   - `appid` (Your API key)
   - `units` (Optional: Set to `metric` for temperatures in Celsius)

   **Example URL for New York**:  
   ```
   https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=New York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric
   ```

3. **Save Results**:
   - Save the JSON response into a file named `cityname_forecast.json`.  
     - Example: `newyork_forecast.json`.

### Steps for POSTMAN Users
1. **Create a Request**:
   - Open POSTMAN and create a new GET request.
   - Paste the API URL with parameters (e.g., `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric`).
2. **Send Request**:
   - Click the **Send** button to get the response.
3. **Save the Response**:
   - Click on the **Save Response** dropdown in the response section.
   - Choose "Download" to save the response as a JSON file.

### Steps for Browser Users
1. **Open API URL**:
   - Paste the full URL with query parameters (e.g., `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric`) into your browser's address bar.
2. **View the JSON Response**:
   - The browser will display the JSON response directly.
3. **Save the JSON**:
   - Copy the JSON response into a text editor and save it as a `.json` file with an appropriate name.

### Submission
- Submit the saved JSON files:
  - `cityname_weather.json` for each city.
  - `cityname_forecast.json` for the 5-day forecast.
- Add a self-reflection text that explains your understanding of these topics.
